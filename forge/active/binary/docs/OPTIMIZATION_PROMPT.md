  - Continuously revises and optimizes the Claude Plan

- **Claude only asks binary questions when:**
  - A strategic fork arises
  - An irreversible or externalized action requires approval
  - Real-world ambiguity blocks a critical process
  - Input could significantly alter projected results

## BINARY QUESTION SEQUENCE & RESPONSES

**Strategic Impact:** Establishes recurring revenue focus, validates subscription economy approach

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-13  
**Strategic Impact:** Price point optimization below sensitivity threshold, competitive positioning

## Optimization Request

As the Meta-Agent optimizer, provide specific actionable directives to:

1. **Increase Revenue Velocity** - What specific tasks should be prioritized/deprioritized?
2. **Reduce Analysis Paralysis** - Which research tasks can be consolidated or eliminated?
3. **Improve Execution Flow** - What process improvements will accelerate completion?

For each directive, provide:
- **ACTION:** Specific task/change
- **RATIONALE:** Why this will improve revenue generation
- **IMPLEMENTATION:** Exact steps to execute
- **IMPACT:** Expected improvement metric

Focus ruthlessly on revenue generation. The goal is $8K+ monthly recurring revenue.

**Current bottlenecks to address:**
- Low task completion suggests execution blockers or unclear task definitions
- Low in-progress task ratio suggests poor task flow management

**Expected outcome:** Clear optimization plan that increases task completion velocity by 40%+ within 1 week.
