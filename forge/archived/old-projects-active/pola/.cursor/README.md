# Alternative Environment Configuration for Claude Code Background Agents

This directory contains optimized environment configurations for Claude Code's background agent system.

## Files:
- `activate_for_claude.sh` - Simplified activation script with absolute paths
- `environment.json` - Updated configuration pointing to the activation script

## Previous Issues:
- Complex command chains in environment.json were causing "Snapshot not found" errors
- Background agent system couldn't reliably execute the compound commands

## Solution:
- Moved complex logic to a dedicated bash script
- Used absolute paths to avoid working directory issues
- Simplified the environment.json to just call the script

## Testing:
The activation script has been tested and validates all required components:
- Virtual environment activation
- Python path verification
- Dependencies installation
- Core module imports

Background agents should now launch successfully.
