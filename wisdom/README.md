# Wisdom

The Wisdom system consolidates knowledge, extracts patterns, and generates insights from the collective intelligence of Manas.

## Directory Structure

- **patterns/**: Discovered patterns and recurring themes
  - technical-patterns/: Migrated technical knowledge patterns
- **insights/**: Generated insights and conclusions
- **research/**: Research findings and explorations
- **documentation/**: System documentation and maps
  - map.md: Living system architecture map
- **meta/**: Meta-knowledge about knowledge itself

## Purpose

Wisdom transforms raw information and memories into actionable intelligence through:
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Insight generation from experiences
- Research synthesis and analysis
- Documentation of system evolution
- Meta-learning about learning
