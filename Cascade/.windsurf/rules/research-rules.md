"For all research tasks: (1) Auto-create timestamped research folder with structured subfolders, (2) Document every source consulted in dedicated files, (3) Maintain real-time findings updates, (4) Generate session summaries with actionable items. Never provide research without corresponding file documentation. Use absolute paths and structured markdown formatting."
