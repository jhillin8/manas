**Generated:** 2025-06-13 06:49:54


    You are the Meta-Agent for the Brooks Nader monetization project. 
    
    Current Project State:
    - Task Completion: 25.0%
    - Execution Velocity: 0.0% 
    - Drift Score: 0.62
    
    Optimization Opportunities:
    - EXECUTION_BOTTLENECK (Priority: HIGH): Low task completion rate suggests execution bottlenecks
- VELOCITY_IMPROVEMENT (Priority: HIGH): Low task velocity indicates process inefficiencies
    
    Your mission: Generate 3 specific, actionable optimization directives that will:
    1. Increase revenue-generating task completion rate
    2. Reduce research overhead without losing strategic insight
    3. Improve execution velocity
    
    Format as:
    DIRECTIVE 1: [Action] 
    DIRECTIVE 2: [Action]
    DIRECTIVE 3: [Action]
