# The Opportunity: Sports Investment Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Sports as a Highly Desirable Investment**

Sports represent an increasingly desirable asset class, with returns exceeding those of other traditional investment classes. While revenue growth is in part responsible for these returns, we are also seeing higher multiples used in appraisals.

### Key Investment Characteristics:

**Above-Market Returns** – From 2000 to 2023 all three major American sports outperformed the S&P 500, even the NHL which is the lowest performing sport in our study matches the S&P 500. A University of Michigan Study confirms that this trend can be found all the way back to 1961.

**Resilience** – Loyal fanbases mean that "Values tend to be less volatile than other investments like stocks and bonds—or, in Wall Street-speak, they are more highly non-correlated with other securities" – University of Michigan. Making sports investments a valuable component of a diversified investment portfolio.

**Lifestyle** – Sports teams ownership offers lifestyle benefits beyond that of most other investments.

**Exclusivity** – There are only so many teams, making exclusivity a driver in the value equation.

**Increased share of TV spend** – "Consumers no longer want to gather around a television at a specific time to watch pre-recorded content. They want content on demand, and sports are nearly the only thing consumers seem to want to watch live. As such, live sports viewership has been singlehandedly driving media revenues globally" – Forbes

**Value of auxiliary businesses** – Merchandise, Hospitality, etc.
